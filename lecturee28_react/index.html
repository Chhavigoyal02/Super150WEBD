<!-- ReactJS : it is a Javascript library

Difference between framework and library:
-library are flexible but a framework is rigid.

NextJS is a framework of ReactJS.

why is react more famous than other libraries/ what are the advantages of react
-react create SPA(Single page Application) ----there is no loading time
-has reusable components
-react has virtual dome
-html code can be written in js code using react because it uses jsx
-it is a component based architecture (divide and rule)

what are disadvantages of react/ why was NextJS introduced
-the search engine optimisation is very poor in react (since it is a SPA the webrowser is not able to know whether a new page is added 
or page is not reloaded so the web browser does not send its web crawlers and the keywords are not identified/given indexes)
-client side rendering
-react has a unidirectional data flow i.e. from a parent to a child according to the way react is written

how many types of components:
two
-class based components --responsible for dynamic changes
-functional components --responsible for static changes

previously in react class based components were used (functional components were also there practically) but since it was difficilt to use 
class based componets , we started using functional components
but since functional components are for static changes, hooks were introduced ( they are like promise, as promise is a function it is also 
a function)
hooks are now used with functional components to ensure easy and dynamic nature

what is a component
-component is a function which returns jsx
-it returns a mixture of html+JS code i.e. jsx is returned

reusable components
components are reused (or called) by
- <sam/>
- <sam> ...... </sam>
here sam is a component

component based architecture(divide and rule) 
-we can divide our code into infinite number of components
-if a single component has an error and there is no correlation with the other components , then only the component will stop working 
without any effect on the other components

a react application can be made using various ways
-parcel
-vite
-create own react
-CRA(create react app)
these all are bundlers 

the browser (it has layout engine and JS engine) can only understand javascript , thus can not understand jsx.
to convert jsx into pure js bable(it is a compiler) is used.

In an application there are many files(including html, css, js, jsx files) these can not all be send to the browser so bundlers are used
to handle these files, make them precise and ensure smooth understanding between the browser and the code

CRA is not optimal to use. Vite/ Parcel are better.


what is CDN
-
-CDNs are not good for production because they need a constant inteernet connection -->
