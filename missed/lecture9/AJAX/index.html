    <!-- AJAX = Asynchronous Javascript and XML -->

    <!-- What is AJAX?
    It is a simple web technique used to load data from the server without a page refresh.
    not a library or framework or tool or object or programming language, it is a technique. -->

    <!-- (whenever i want to change some other data, and i page get refresh the it is called multi page application/MPA; eg-wikepedia) 
     but only data is being change so this can be done without refreshing the page-->

    <!-- AJAX helps to make a single page application means dont reloading the page again and again. -->

    <!-- Two model of sending requests:- 1. Traditional method 2. AJAX
     In ajax model there is a JS layer between client and server through which request and response is passing. 
     in js layer there will be js only(i.e data) not html not css so repsonse will be herer only data(or js) unlike the tranditional model where response is html+css+js; 
     so now what's the benifit, now when there is no new html or css means there is no page only data(js) is being transferred which can be manipulated by DOM-->


     <!-- Now, data (js) which is being transefered is of two forms:- 1. XML 2. JSON
     XML = Extensible Markup Language and JSON = JavaScript Object Notation
     XML is a markup language and JSON is a data format. -->

     <!-- In json data the key is always in double quotes only and value can be in double quotes or without double quotes. 
      and mostly used is JSON format.-->
